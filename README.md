Sensor Data Transportation to Cloud
===========

Nowadays, technological achievements in user context monitoring techniques enable automating certain computational tasks which are executed by anticipating the user's intention. Smartphones enrich the mobile applications with proactive behavior in usability that allows fitting contextual requirements in real-time. Generally, such behavior is achieved by the mobile device itself through the use of embedded micromechanical artifacts that enable perceiving the environment. Furthermore,
mobile applications can benefit from distributed pervasive services located in the environment in order to enhance the mobile experience of the user, like in the case of context-aware games, domotic applications, etc. However, pervasive services for mobile users are constrained to the hardware limitations of the electronic appliances (e.g. CPU power, memory, storage, energy, etc) used for sensing the context. Thus, pervasive services are not able to scale on demand and perform data-intensive processing. To overcome the issues regarding scalability, data integrity and processing power deficiencies and to enrich the smartphone applications with detailed and consistent contextual information, current implementation provides a XMPP solution for transporting sensor data from Arduino microcontroller
to the cloud. Arduino provides low-cost hardware, while the cloud offers the reliable and high-availability means for storing and processing sensor data.
